### Description

There are 30 teams in Major League Baseball, each one of those teams can have on average around 5 affilaite teams which they use to develop upcoming players. From high to low, these affilaite teams play in leagues such as Triple A (AAA), Double A (AA), High A (A+), Single A (A), Short-Season A (SS), and Rookie (R). This backend serves up such information in an API which is utilized by another frontend project of mine: [baseball-react](https://github.com/matthewdoles/baseball-react).
